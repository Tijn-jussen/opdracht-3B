          <p> 
            Carlton Banks is a character from the TV show "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air." He's known for being kind of uptight and conservative, 
            which creates a funny contrast with his cousin Will, who is more laid-back. One of the things he's really famous for is his quirky dance called the "Carlton Dance." It's a fun and memorable part of the show, and the character is played by actor Alfonso Ribeiro.
         <br><br>
            Carlton is a highly rational, respectful, and caring individual; however, he can be annoying, naive, and cocky. He dresses preppy and 
            is a conservative Republican who loves Tom Jones and Macaulay Culkin. Carlton tends to have difficulty thinking about others and is often at odds with his cousin, Will Smith, although he is Will's best friend and brother figure.
